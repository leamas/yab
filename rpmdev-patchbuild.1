.TH RPMDEV-PATCHBUILD "1" "Last change: Aug 2015" "rpmdev-pathcbuild @VERSION" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
rpmdev-patchbuild - synchronize patch set between spec and source
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpmdev-patchbuild [\fIoptions\fR] <\fIcommand\fR> [\fIspec file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIrpmdev-patchbuild\fR is designed to support the workflow when
maintaining patches in RPM spec files. It can export existing
patches to a build tree. This build tree can be modified with new
or updated patches. Eventually, the patches in the spec file can
be updated (i. e., replaced) with the patches in the build tree.
.SH ARGUMENTS
The \fIcommand\fR argument is one of
.RS 4
.TP
\fBexport\fR
Retrieves the sources as defined in the spec file and unpacks them into
a build tree. The patches in the spec are applied as a patch series in this
tree.
.TP
\fBimport\fR
Import the patches from the build tree. The patches in the spec file are
replaced with the patches from build tree.
.TP
\fBstatus\fR
Display the patch status. A patch can be deleted, new, modified or
unchanged. A new patch might conflict if using a numeric prefix used
by another patch
.RE
.TP
\fBspec file\fR
The spec file to use. Defaults to a *.spec (which must match a single
file to work).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-m\fR ,\fB\-\-mode\fR [\fIgit\fR|\fIquilt\fR]

Work either in  git or quilt mode.
.IP
In git mode the build tree will be initiated with a \fIgit(1)\fR
repository, and each patch in the spec will be applied using
\fIgit am\fR. Requires that all spec patches are git-formatted.
This mode is used by default if all patches in the spec are deemed
as git patches according to some heuristics.
.IP
In quilt mode the build tree will be initiated with a \fIquilt(1)\fR
patchset. This mode can always be used, it does not parse or generate
any patch metadata. It also leaves patch naming inclusive numbering
to the user. Quilt mode is used by default if at least one patch is
deemed as non-git.
.TP
\fB-d\fR,\fB\-\-delete\fR
When importing patches to spec, delete unused ones. By default
patches are lefft in spec wit a message that they are unused.
.TP
\fB-o\fR,\fB\-\-options\fR
Options used with  %patch when importing new patches. Defaults to
\fI-p1\fR. Existing %patch invocations are used as-is.
.TP
\fB-w\fR,\fB\-\-working-dir\fR
Build directory where sources are unpacked. Defaults to \fIpatchbuild\fr.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR,\fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage summary.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR,\fB\-\-version\fR
Display version.

.SH PATCH NUMBERING
When imported a new patch must be designated a number. If the patch
filename doesnt have a numeric prefix the next available number is
used. It the patch has a numeric prefix it will be used unless it's
already used in the spec. In this case there is a warning and next
available number is used.

.SH EXAMPLES
A session using \fBrpmdev-patchbuild\fR might look like:
.nf
    $ fedpkg clone foo
    $ cd foo
    $ rpmdev-patchbuild export
    $ cd patchbuild/foo-1.0.3
    < patch the code and update patches>
    $ cd ../..
    $ rpmdev-patchbuild status
    $ rpmdev-patchbuild import
    $ rpmbuild -D "_sourcedir $PWD" -ba *.spec
    < patch broken... fix in patchbuild/foo-1.0.3>
    $ rpmdev-patchbuild import
    $ rpmbuild -D "_sourcedir $PWD" -ba *.spec
    <all OK, commit changes in main git repo>
    $ git commit -am "foo fixed with new patches"
.fi
